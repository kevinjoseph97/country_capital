World Atlas 

This is a World Atlas application. You will be able to learn about a country's capital, population, 
the different timezones, and which region of the world its located in. You can even search
for a country using its 2 letter alpha code. We will be giving the user the to choice to pick any counrty they deisre 
and then return to them the different options about their country of choice.


Installation
Before we begin, its important that we have the proper gems installed. These two gems below will be required in order for us
to properly run this appilcation. 

gem 'pry'
gem 'httparty'

To install them, in your terminal run: gem install "gem name"
If you want to use other gems you can visit (https://rubygems.org) and find one that suits you. 

Once you have all the gems needed - run "bundle install" in your terminal and follow the prompts.

Remember to call on these gems in your environment file so they can be accessible within your application. 

You will then need to call on the environment file insdie the run file which is the one to be executed on launch. 

There will be no tests that are run within this application so we won't have to worry about that.
